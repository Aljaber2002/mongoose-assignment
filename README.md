How to run the application locally?

Ans:Here is my project.My project name is Mongoose assignment.In my project i have used Typescript for serverside language.I have used mongodb for insert my user data and validation purpose i have used mongoose.we know that mongoose is libray which is for object data modeling.Also i have used joi schema third party libray for validation.you can run my project two diffrent ways .such as i installed 'ts-dot-nev' so that our typescript code wil automitacally convert into js also run my server.when you write it in terminal server will automitacally run and the command is "npm run start:dev".The another way you can run my project locally and the command is "npm run start:prod".Also you can run this command 'npm run lint' to find my project error or warning.

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/ (POST)

Here is the localhost link here you can creat user.

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/ (GET)

here is the link.And by this link you can get all users from database.

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId (GET)

By this route you can get single user from database just eneter their personal userId.

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId (DELETE)

By this route you can delete single user according to their userId

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId (UPDATE)

If you want update the single user information by their route then you can update their document with their information

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId/orders (GET)

By this route we can know the order information of specific user.

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId/orders/total-price (GET)

By this route we can know the total add to cart price in order of a specific user by their userId

## http://localhost:5000/api/users/:userId/orders/

By this route we can update the order informaton of specific user.

Thats way you can locally run my project.Thank you
