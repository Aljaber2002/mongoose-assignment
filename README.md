How to run the application locally?
Ans:Here is my project.My project name is Mongoose assignment.In my project i have used Typescript for serverside language.I have used mongodb for insert my user data and validation purpose i have used mongoose.we know that mongoose is libray which is for object data modeling.Also i have used joi schema third party libray for validation.you can run my project two diffrent ways .such as i installed 'ts-dot-nev' so that our typescript code wil automitacally convert into js also run my server.when you write it in terminal server will automitacally run and the command is "npm run start:dev".The another way you can run my project locally and the command is "npm run start:prod".Also you can run this command 'npm run lint' to find my project error or warning.Thats way you can locally run my project.Thank you
